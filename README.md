# PAPER-AI

*Bridging Innovation and Impact with AI*

How can we design AI solutions that work beyond the digital divide—without reliable electricity, high-powered computing, or internet access? 

The PAPER-AI competition invites students, researchers, and innovators to tackle some of the world’s most pressing challenges through sustainable and accessible AI.

- Interested individuals will need to identify their own team members and complete a short proposal before the registration deadline
- Select teams will be invited to a **virtual incubation program** where they will be paired with domain experts and community stakeholders
